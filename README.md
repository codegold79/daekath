## Slack slash command

Two versions will be written, one for GCP Cloud Functions and the other for AWS Lambda.

The Cloud Function version was made following the tutorial located [here](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/tutorials/slack#functions-clone-sample-repository-go). Of course, I've made some modifications.

The Lambda version was made by basically copying the first version and making some changes for my purposes.
